  intro: "Kuping DJ started from the concerns of local DJ community members: difficulty in finding legal releases, fear of copyright strikes when performing or uploading to YouTube. Therefore, since 2024, we have built a fair system for musicians and a comfortable experience for buyers.",
  details: "Starting with just 10 releases, there are now thousands of catalogs and dozens of active DJs on this platform."
